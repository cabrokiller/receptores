Amitriptyline,Potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily A member 1,Potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily A member 1,Blocker/inhibitor,KCNA1,No,NA,KCNA,square-x,"Voltage-gated potassium channel that mediates transmembrane
potassium transport in excitable membranes, primarily in
the brain and the central nervous system, but also in the
kidney (PubMed:19903818). Contributes to the regulation of
the membrane potential and nerve signaling, and prevents
neuronal hyperexcitability (PubMed:17156368). Forms
tetrameric potassium-selective channels through which
potassium ions pass in accordance with their electrochemical
gradient. The channel alternates between opened and
closed conformations in response to the voltage difference
across the membrane (PubMed:19912772). Can form functional
homotetrameric channels and heterotetrameric channels that
contain variable proportions of KCNA1, KCNA2, KCNA4, KCNA5,
KCNA6, KCNA7, and possibly other family members as well;
channel properties depend on the type of alpha subunits that
are part of the channel (PubMed:12077175, PubMed:17156368).
Channel properties are modulated by cytoplasmic beta
subunits that regulate the subcellular location of the alpha
subunits and promote rapid inactivation of delayed rectifier
potassium channels (PubMed:12077175, PubMed:17156368). In
vivo, membranes probably contain a mixture of heteromeric
potassium channel complexes, making it difficult to assign
currents observed in intact tissues to any particular
potassium channel family member. Homotetrameric KCNA1 forms
a delayed-rectifier potassium channel that opens in response
to membrane depolarization, followed by slow spontaneous
channel closure (PubMed:19912772, PubMed:19968958, PubMed:
19307729, PubMed:19903818). In contrast, a heterotetrameric
channel formed by KCNA1 and KCNA4 shows rapid inactivation
(PubMed:17156368). Regulates neuronal excitability in
hippocampus, especially in mossy fibers and medial perforant
path axons, preventing neuronal hyperexcitability. Response
to toxins that are selective for KCNA1, respectively for
KCNA2, suggests that heteromeric potassium channels composed
of both KCNA1 and KCNA2 play a role in pacemaking and
regulate the output of deep cerebellar nuclear neurons (By
similarity). May function as down-stream effector for G

Amitriptyline,Mu-type opioid receptor,Mu-type opioid ,Binder,OPRM1,Unknown,NA,OPRM,diamond-wide,"Receptor for endogenous opioids such as beta-endorphin
and endomorphin. Receptor for natural and synthetic
opioids including morphine, heroin, DAMGO, fentanyl,
etorphine, buprenorphin and methadone. Agonist binding
to the receptor induces coupling to an inactive GDP-bound
heterotrimeric G-protein complex and subsequent exchange
of GDP for GTP in the G-protein alpha subunit leading to
dissociation of the G-protein complex with the free GTP-
bound G-protein alpha and the G-protein beta-gamma dimer
activating downstream cellular effectors. The agonist- and
cell type-specific activity is predominantly coupled to
pertussis toxin-sensitive G(i) and G(o) G alpha proteins,
GNAI1, GNAI2, GNAI3 and GNAO1 isoforms Alpha-1 and Alpha-2,
and to a lesser extend to pertussis toxin-insensitive
G alpha proteins GNAZ and GNA15. They mediate an array
of downstream cellular responses, including inhibition
of adenylate cyclase activity and both N-type and L-
type calcium channels, activation of inward rectifying
potassium channels, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK),
phospholipase C (PLC), phosphoinositide/protein kinase
(PKC), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and regulation of
NF-kappa-B. Also couples to adenylate cyclase stimulatory
G alpha proteins. The selective temporal coupling to G-
proteins and subsequent signaling can be regulated by RGSZ
proteins, such as RGS9, RGS17 and RGS4. Phosphorylation by
members of the GPRK subfamily of Ser/Thr protein kinases
and association with beta-arrestins is involved in short-
term receptor desensitization. Beta-arrestins associate
with the GPRK-phosphorylated receptor and uncouple it from
the G-protein thus terminating signal transduction. The
phosphorylated receptor is internalized through endocytosis
via clathrin-coated pits which involves beta-arrestins.
The activation of the ERK pathway occurs either in a G-
protein-dependent or a beta-arrestin-dependent manner and
is regulated by agonist-specific receptor phosphorylation.
Acts as a class A G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) which
dissociates from beta-arrestin at or near the plasma
membrane and undergoes rapid recycling. Receptor down-
regulation pathways are varying with the agonist and occur
dependent or independent of G-protein coupling. Endogenous
ligands induce rapid desensitization, endocytosis and
recycling whereas morphine induces only low desensitization
and endocytosis. Heterooligomerization with other GPCRs
can modulate agonist binding, signaling and trafficking
properties. Involved in neurogenesis. Isoform 12 couples to
GNAS and is proposed to be involved in excitatory effects.
Isoform 16 and isoform 17 do not bind agonists but may

Buprenorphine,Mu-type opioid receptor,Mu-type opioid ,Partial agonist,OPRM1,Yes,NA,OPRM,hexagram,"Receptor for endogenous opioids such as beta-endorphin
and endomorphin. Receptor for natural and synthetic
opioids including morphine, heroin, DAMGO, fentanyl,
etorphine, buprenorphin and methadone. Agonist binding
to the receptor induces coupling to an inactive GDP-bound
heterotrimeric G-protein complex and subsequent exchange
of GDP for GTP in the G-protein alpha subunit leading to
dissociation of the G-protein complex with the free GTP-
bound G-protein alpha and the G-protein beta-gamma dimer
activating downstream cellular effectors. The agonist- and
cell type-specific activity is predominantly coupled to
pertussis toxin-sensitive G(i) and G(o) G alpha proteins,
GNAI1, GNAI2, GNAI3 and GNAO1 isoforms Alpha-1 and Alpha-2,
and to a lesser extend to pertussis toxin-insensitive
G alpha proteins GNAZ and GNA15. They mediate an array
of downstream cellular responses, including inhibition
of adenylate cyclase activity and both N-type and L-
type calcium channels, activation of inward rectifying
potassium channels, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK),
phospholipase C (PLC), phosphoinositide/protein kinase
(PKC), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and regulation of
NF-kappa-B. Also couples to adenylate cyclase stimulatory
G alpha proteins. The selective temporal coupling to G-
proteins and subsequent signaling can be regulated by RGSZ
proteins, such as RGS9, RGS17 and RGS4. Phosphorylation by
members of the GPRK subfamily of Ser/Thr protein kinases
and association with beta-arrestins is involved in short-
term receptor desensitization. Beta-arrestins associate
with the GPRK-phosphorylated receptor and uncouple it from
the G-protein thus terminating signal transduction. The
phosphorylated receptor is internalized through endocytosis
via clathrin-coated pits which involves beta-arrestins.
The activation of the ERK pathway occurs either in a G-
protein-dependent or a beta-arrestin-dependent manner and
is regulated by agonist-specific receptor phosphorylation.
Acts as a class A G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) which
dissociates from beta-arrestin at or near the plasma
membrane and undergoes rapid recycling. Receptor down-
regulation pathways are varying with the agonist and occur
dependent or independent of G-protein coupling. Endogenous
ligands induce rapid desensitization, endocytosis and
recycling whereas morphine induces only low desensitization
and endocytosis. Heterooligomerization with other GPCRs
can modulate agonist binding, signaling and trafficking
properties. Involved in neurogenesis. Isoform 12 couples to
GNAS and is proposed to be involved in excitatory effects.
Isoform 16 and isoform 17 do not bind agonists but may
act through oligomerization with binding-competent OPRM1
isoforms and reduce their ligand binding activity."

25282151). The channel is permeable to a range of divalent
cations including calcium, the influx of which may activate
a potassium current which hyperpolarizes the cell membrane
(PubMed:11752216, PubMed:25282151). In the ear, this may
lead to a reduction in basilar membrane motion, altering the
activity of auditory nerve fibers and reducing the range of

activating downstream cellular effectors. The agonist- and
cell type-specific activity is predominantly coupled to
pertussis toxin-sensitive G(i) and G(o) G alpha proteins,
GNAI1, GNAI2, GNAI3 and GNAO1 isoforms Alpha-1 and Alpha-2,
and to a lesser extend to pertussis toxin-insensitive
G alpha proteins GNAZ and GNA15. They mediate an array
of downstream cellular responses, including inhibition
of adenylate cyclase activity and both N-type and L-
type calcium channels, activation of inward rectifying
potassium channels, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK),
phospholipase C (PLC), phosphoinositide/protein kinase
(PKC), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and regulation of
NF-kappa-B. Also couples to adenylate cyclase stimulatory
G alpha proteins. The selective temporal coupling to G-
proteins and subsequent signaling can be regulated by RGSZ
proteins, such as RGS9, RGS17 and RGS4. Phosphorylation by
members of the GPRK subfamily of Ser/Thr protein kinases
and association with beta-arrestins is involved in short-
term receptor desensitization. Beta-arrestins associate
with the GPRK-phosphorylated receptor and uncouple it from
the G-protein thus terminating signal transduction. The
phosphorylated receptor is internalized through endocytosis
via clathrin-coated pits which involves beta-arrestins.
The activation of the ERK pathway occurs either in a G-
protein-dependent or a beta-arrestin-dependent manner and
is regulated by agonist-specific receptor phosphorylation.
Acts as a class A G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) which
dissociates from beta-arrestin at or near the plasma
membrane and undergoes rapid recycling. Receptor down-
regulation pathways are varying with the agonist and occur
dependent or independent of G-protein coupling. Endogenous
ligands induce rapid desensitization, endocytosis and
recycling whereas morphine induces only low desensitization
and endocytosis. Heterooligomerization with other GPCRs
can modulate agonist binding, signaling and trafficking
properties. Involved in neurogenesis. Isoform 12 couples to
GNAS and is proposed to be involved in excitatory effects.
Isoform 16 and isoform 17 do not bind agonists but may
act through oligomerization with binding-competent OPRM1
isoforms and reduce their ligand binding activity."

heterotrimeric G-protein complex and subsequent exchange
of GDP for GTP in the G-protein alpha subunit leading to
dissociation of the G-protein complex with the free GTP-
bound G-protein alpha and the G-protein beta-gamma dimer
activating downstream cellular effectors. The agonist- and
cell type-specific activity is predominantly coupled to
pertussis toxin-sensitive G(i) and G(o) G alpha proteins,
GNAI1, GNAI2, GNAI3 and GNAO1 isoforms Alpha-1 and Alpha-2,
and to a lesser extend to pertussis toxin-insensitive
G alpha proteins GNAZ and GNA15. They mediate an array
of downstream cellular responses, including inhibition

potassium channels, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK),
phospholipase C (PLC), phosphoinositide/protein kinase
(PKC), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and regulation of
NF-kappa-B. Also couples to adenylate cyclase stimulatory
G alpha proteins. The selective temporal coupling to G-
proteins and subsequent signaling can be regulated by RGSZ
proteins, such as RGS9, RGS17 and RGS4. Phosphorylation by
members of the GPRK subfamily of Ser/Thr protein kinases
and association with beta-arrestins is involved in short-
term receptor desensitization. Beta-arrestins associate
with the GPRK-phosphorylated receptor and uncouple it from
the G-protein thus terminating signal transduction. The
phosphorylated receptor is internalized through endocytosis
via clathrin-coated pits which involves beta-arrestins.
The activation of the ERK pathway occurs either in a G-
protein-dependent or a beta-arrestin-dependent manner and
is regulated by agonist-specific receptor phosphorylation.
Acts as a class A G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) which
dissociates from beta-arrestin at or near the plasma
membrane and undergoes rapid recycling. Receptor down-
regulation pathways are varying with the agonist and occur
dependent or independent of G-protein coupling. Endogenous
ligands induce rapid desensitization, endocytosis and
recycling whereas morphine induces only low desensitization
and endocytosis. Heterooligomerization with other GPCRs
can modulate agonist binding, signaling and trafficking
properties. Involved in neurogenesis. Isoform 12 couples to

Oxycodone,Mu-type opioid receptor,Mu-type opioid ,Agonist,OPRM1,Yes,NA,OPRM,star-triangle-up,"Receptor for endogenous opioids such as beta-endorphin
and endomorphin. Receptor for natural and synthetic
opioids including morphine, heroin, DAMGO, fentanyl,
etorphine, buprenorphin and methadone. Agonist binding
to the receptor induces coupling to an inactive GDP-bound
heterotrimeric G-protein complex and subsequent exchange
of GDP for GTP in the G-protein alpha subunit leading to
dissociation of the G-protein complex with the free GTP-
bound G-protein alpha and the G-protein beta-gamma dimer
activating downstream cellular effectors. The agonist- and
cell type-specific activity is predominantly coupled to
pertussis toxin-sensitive G(i) and G(o) G alpha proteins,
GNAI1, GNAI2, GNAI3 and GNAO1 isoforms Alpha-1 and Alpha-2,
and to a lesser extend to pertussis toxin-insensitive
G alpha proteins GNAZ and GNA15. They mediate an array
of downstream cellular responses, including inhibition
of adenylate cyclase activity and both N-type and L-
type calcium channels, activation of inward rectifying
potassium channels, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK),
phospholipase C (PLC), phosphoinositide/protein kinase
(PKC), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and regulation of
NF-kappa-B. Also couples to adenylate cyclase stimulatory
G alpha proteins. The selective temporal coupling to G-
proteins and subsequent signaling can be regulated by RGSZ
proteins, such as RGS9, RGS17 and RGS4. Phosphorylation by
members of the GPRK subfamily of Ser/Thr protein kinases
and association with beta-arrestins is involved in short-
term receptor desensitization. Beta-arrestins associate
with the GPRK-phosphorylated receptor and uncouple it from
the G-protein thus terminating signal transduction. The
phosphorylated receptor is internalized through endocytosis
via clathrin-coated pits which involves beta-arrestins.
The activation of the ERK pathway occurs either in a G-
protein-dependent or a beta-arrestin-dependent manner and
is regulated by agonist-specific receptor phosphorylation.
Acts as a class A G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) which
dissociates from beta-arrestin at or near the plasma
membrane and undergoes rapid recycling. Receptor down-
regulation pathways are varying with the agonist and occur
dependent or independent of G-protein coupling. Endogenous
ligands induce rapid desensitization, endocytosis and
recycling whereas morphine induces only low desensitization
and endocytosis. Heterooligomerization with other GPCRs
can modulate agonist binding, signaling and trafficking
properties. Involved in neurogenesis. Isoform 12 couples to
GNAS and is proposed to be involved in excitatory effects.
Isoform 16 and isoform 17 do not bind agonists but may
act through oligomerization with binding-competent OPRM1
isoforms and reduce their ligand binding activity."

Paroxetine,Serotonin Receptors (Protein Group),Serotonin Receptors (Protein Group),Other/unknown,NA,Unknown,NA,NE,circle-dot,"G-protein coupled receptor for 5-hydroxytryptamine
(serotonin). Also functions as a receptor for various
drugs and psychoactive substances. Ligand binding causes
a conformation change that triggers signaling via guanine
nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) and modulates
the activity of down-stream effectors, such as adenylate
cyclase. Beta-arrestin family members inhibit signaling via
G proteins and mediate activation of alternative signaling
pathways. Signaling inhibits adenylate cyclase activity and
activates a phosphatidylinositol-calcium second messenger
system that regulates the release of Ca(2+) ions from
intracellular stores. Plays a role in the regulation of 5-
hydroxytryptamine release and in the regulation of dopamine
and 5-hydroxytryptamine metabolism. Plays a role in the
regulation of dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine levels
in the brain, and thereby affects neural activity, mood
and behavior. Plays a role in the response to anxiogenic
stimuli."
