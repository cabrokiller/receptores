the brain and the central nervous system, but also in the
kidney (PubMed:19903818). Contributes to the regulation of
the membrane potential and nerve signaling, and prevents
neuronal hyperexcitability (PubMed:17156368). Forms
tetrameric potassium-selective channels through which
potassium ions pass in accordance with their electrochemical
gradient. The channel alternates between opened and
closed conformations in response to the voltage difference
across the membrane (PubMed:19912772). Can form functional
homotetrameric channels and heterotetrameric channels that
contain variable proportions of KCNA1, KCNA2, KCNA4, KCNA5,

heterotrimeric G-protein complex and subsequent exchange
of GDP for GTP in the G-protein alpha subunit leading to

GNAI1, GNAI2, GNAI3 and GNAO1 isoforms Alpha-1 and Alpha-2,
and to a lesser extend to pertussis toxin-insensitive

proteins and subsequent signaling can be regulated by RGSZ
proteins, such as RGS9, RGS17 and RGS4. Phosphorylation by
members of the GPRK subfamily of Ser/Thr protein kinases

dissociates from beta-arrestin at or near the plasma
membrane and undergoes rapid recycling. Receptor down-
regulation pathways are varying with the agonist and occur
dependent or independent of G-protein coupling. Endogenous
ligands induce rapid desensitization, endocytosis and

Buprenorphine,Mu-type opioid receptor,Mu-type opioid ,Partial agonist,OPRM1,Yes,NA,OPRM,hexagram,"Receptor for endogenous opioids such as beta-endorphin
and endomorphin. Receptor for natural and synthetic
opioids including morphine, heroin, DAMGO, fentanyl,
etorphine, buprenorphin and methadone. Agonist binding
to the receptor induces coupling to an inactive GDP-bound
heterotrimeric G-protein complex and subsequent exchange
of GDP for GTP in the G-protein alpha subunit leading to
dissociation of the G-protein complex with the free GTP-
bound G-protein alpha and the G-protein beta-gamma dimer
activating downstream cellular effectors. The agonist- and
cell type-specific activity is predominantly coupled to
pertussis toxin-sensitive G(i) and G(o) G alpha proteins,
GNAI1, GNAI2, GNAI3 and GNAO1 isoforms Alpha-1 and Alpha-2,
and to a lesser extend to pertussis toxin-insensitive
G alpha proteins GNAZ and GNA15. They mediate an array
of downstream cellular responses, including inhibition
of adenylate cyclase activity and both N-type and L-
type calcium channels, activation of inward rectifying
potassium channels, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK),
phospholipase C (PLC), phosphoinositide/protein kinase
(PKC), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and regulation of
NF-kappa-B. Also couples to adenylate cyclase stimulatory
G alpha proteins. The selective temporal coupling to G-
proteins and subsequent signaling can be regulated by RGSZ
proteins, such as RGS9, RGS17 and RGS4. Phosphorylation by
members of the GPRK subfamily of Ser/Thr protein kinases
and association with beta-arrestins is involved in short-
term receptor desensitization. Beta-arrestins associate
with the GPRK-phosphorylated receptor and uncouple it from
the G-protein thus terminating signal transduction. The
phosphorylated receptor is internalized through endocytosis
via clathrin-coated pits which involves beta-arrestins.
The activation of the ERK pathway occurs either in a G-
protein-dependent or a beta-arrestin-dependent manner and
is regulated by agonist-specific receptor phosphorylation.
Acts as a class A G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) which
dissociates from beta-arrestin at or near the plasma
membrane and undergoes rapid recycling. Receptor down-
regulation pathways are varying with the agonist and occur
dependent or independent of G-protein coupling. Endogenous
ligands induce rapid desensitization, endocytosis and
recycling whereas morphine induces only low desensitization
and endocytosis. Heterooligomerization with other GPCRs
can modulate agonist binding, signaling and trafficking
properties. Involved in neurogenesis. Isoform 12 couples to
GNAS and is proposed to be involved in excitatory effects.
Isoform 16 and isoform 17 do not bind agonists but may
act through oligomerization with binding-competent OPRM1
isoforms and reduce their ligand binding activity.",NA,NA,NA

potassium transport in excitable membranes, primarily in
the brain. Mediates the major part of the dendritic A-
type current I(SA) in brain neurons (By similarity). This
current is activated at membrane potentials that are below
the threshold for action potentials. It regulates neuronal
excitability, prolongs the latency before the first spike
in a series of action potentials, regulates the frequency
of repetitive action potential firing, shortens the duration
of action potentials and regulates the back-propagation
of action potentials from the neuronal cell body to the
dendrites. Contributes to the regulation of the circadian
rhytm of action potential firing in suprachiasmatic nucleus
neurons, which regulates the circadian rhythm of locomotor

opened and closed conformations in response to the voltage
difference across the membrane (PubMed:11507158). Can form
functional homotetrameric channels and heterotetrameric
channels that contain variable proportions of KCND2 and
KCND3; channel properties depend on the type of pore-
forming alpha subunits that are part of the channel. In
vivo, membranes probably contain a mixture of heteromeric
potassium channel complexes. Interaction with specific
isoforms of the regulatory subunits KCNIP1, KCNIP2, KCNIP3
or KCNIP4 strongly increases expression at the cell surface
and thereby increases channel activity; it modulates the
kinetics of channel activation and inactivation, shifts
the threshold for channel activation to more negative
voltage values, shifts the threshold for inactivation
to less negative voltages and accelerates recovery after
inactivation (PubMed:15454437, PubMed:14623880, PubMed:

heterotrimeric G-protein complex and subsequent exchange
of GDP for GTP in the G-protein alpha subunit leading to
dissociation of the G-protein complex with the free GTP-
bound G-protein alpha and the G-protein beta-gamma dimer
activating downstream cellular effectors. The agonist- and
cell type-specific activity is predominantly coupled to
pertussis toxin-sensitive G(i) and G(o) G alpha proteins,
GNAI1, GNAI2, GNAI3 and GNAO1 isoforms Alpha-1 and Alpha-2,
and to a lesser extend to pertussis toxin-insensitive
G alpha proteins GNAZ and GNA15. They mediate an array

type calcium channels, activation of inward rectifying
potassium channels, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK),
phospholipase C (PLC), phosphoinositide/protein kinase
(PKC), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and regulation of
NF-kappa-B. Also couples to adenylate cyclase stimulatory
G alpha proteins. The selective temporal coupling to G-
proteins and subsequent signaling can be regulated by RGSZ
proteins, such as RGS9, RGS17 and RGS4. Phosphorylation by
members of the GPRK subfamily of Ser/Thr protein kinases
and association with beta-arrestins is involved in short-
term receptor desensitization. Beta-arrestins associate
with the GPRK-phosphorylated receptor and uncouple it from
the G-protein thus terminating signal transduction. The
phosphorylated receptor is internalized through endocytosis
via clathrin-coated pits which involves beta-arrestins.
The activation of the ERK pathway occurs either in a G-
protein-dependent or a beta-arrestin-dependent manner and
is regulated by agonist-specific receptor phosphorylation.
Acts as a class A G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) which
dissociates from beta-arrestin at or near the plasma
membrane and undergoes rapid recycling. Receptor down-
regulation pathways are varying with the agonist and occur
dependent or independent of G-protein coupling. Endogenous
ligands induce rapid desensitization, endocytosis and
recycling whereas morphine induces only low desensitization
and endocytosis. Heterooligomerization with other GPCRs
can modulate agonist binding, signaling and trafficking
properties. Involved in neurogenesis. Isoform 12 couples to

Naltrexone,Mu-type opioid receptor,Mu-type opioid ,Antagonist,OPRM1,Yes,9.698970004336019,OPRM,star-triangle-down,"Receptor for endogenous opioids such as beta-endorphin
and endomorphin. Receptor for natural and synthetic
opioids including morphine, heroin, DAMGO, fentanyl,
etorphine, buprenorphin and methadone. Agonist binding
to the receptor induces coupling to an inactive GDP-bound
heterotrimeric G-protein complex and subsequent exchange
of GDP for GTP in the G-protein alpha subunit leading to
dissociation of the G-protein complex with the free GTP-
bound G-protein alpha and the G-protein beta-gamma dimer
activating downstream cellular effectors. The agonist- and
cell type-specific activity is predominantly coupled to
pertussis toxin-sensitive G(i) and G(o) G alpha proteins,
GNAI1, GNAI2, GNAI3 and GNAO1 isoforms Alpha-1 and Alpha-2,
and to a lesser extend to pertussis toxin-insensitive
G alpha proteins GNAZ and GNA15. They mediate an array
of downstream cellular responses, including inhibition
of adenylate cyclase activity and both N-type and L-
type calcium channels, activation of inward rectifying
potassium channels, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK),
phospholipase C (PLC), phosphoinositide/protein kinase
(PKC), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and regulation of
NF-kappa-B. Also couples to adenylate cyclase stimulatory
G alpha proteins. The selective temporal coupling to G-
proteins and subsequent signaling can be regulated by RGSZ
proteins, such as RGS9, RGS17 and RGS4. Phosphorylation by
members of the GPRK subfamily of Ser/Thr protein kinases
and association with beta-arrestins is involved in short-
term receptor desensitization. Beta-arrestins associate
with the GPRK-phosphorylated receptor and uncouple it from
the G-protein thus terminating signal transduction. The
phosphorylated receptor is internalized through endocytosis
via clathrin-coated pits which involves beta-arrestins.
The activation of the ERK pathway occurs either in a G-
protein-dependent or a beta-arrestin-dependent manner and
is regulated by agonist-specific receptor phosphorylation.
Acts as a class A G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) which
dissociates from beta-arrestin at or near the plasma
membrane and undergoes rapid recycling. Receptor down-
regulation pathways are varying with the agonist and occur
dependent or independent of G-protein coupling. Endogenous
ligands induce rapid desensitization, endocytosis and
recycling whereas morphine induces only low desensitization
and endocytosis. Heterooligomerization with other GPCRs
can modulate agonist binding, signaling and trafficking
properties. Involved in neurogenesis. Isoform 12 couples to
GNAS and is proposed to be involved in excitatory effects.
Isoform 16 and isoform 17 do not bind agonists but may
act through oligomerization with binding-competent OPRM1
isoforms and reduce their ligand binding activity.",2,2,2

Oxycodone,Mu-type opioid receptor,Mu-type opioid ,Agonist,OPRM1,Yes,NA,OPRM,star-triangle-up,"Receptor for endogenous opioids such as beta-endorphin
and endomorphin. Receptor for natural and synthetic
opioids including morphine, heroin, DAMGO, fentanyl,
etorphine, buprenorphin and methadone. Agonist binding
to the receptor induces coupling to an inactive GDP-bound
heterotrimeric G-protein complex and subsequent exchange
of GDP for GTP in the G-protein alpha subunit leading to
dissociation of the G-protein complex with the free GTP-
bound G-protein alpha and the G-protein beta-gamma dimer
activating downstream cellular effectors. The agonist- and
cell type-specific activity is predominantly coupled to
pertussis toxin-sensitive G(i) and G(o) G alpha proteins,
GNAI1, GNAI2, GNAI3 and GNAO1 isoforms Alpha-1 and Alpha-2,
and to a lesser extend to pertussis toxin-insensitive
G alpha proteins GNAZ and GNA15. They mediate an array
of downstream cellular responses, including inhibition
of adenylate cyclase activity and both N-type and L-
type calcium channels, activation of inward rectifying
potassium channels, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK),
phospholipase C (PLC), phosphoinositide/protein kinase
(PKC), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and regulation of
NF-kappa-B. Also couples to adenylate cyclase stimulatory
G alpha proteins. The selective temporal coupling to G-
proteins and subsequent signaling can be regulated by RGSZ
proteins, such as RGS9, RGS17 and RGS4. Phosphorylation by
members of the GPRK subfamily of Ser/Thr protein kinases
and association with beta-arrestins is involved in short-
term receptor desensitization. Beta-arrestins associate
with the GPRK-phosphorylated receptor and uncouple it from
the G-protein thus terminating signal transduction. The
phosphorylated receptor is internalized through endocytosis
via clathrin-coated pits which involves beta-arrestins.
The activation of the ERK pathway occurs either in a G-
protein-dependent or a beta-arrestin-dependent manner and
is regulated by agonist-specific receptor phosphorylation.
Acts as a class A G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) which
dissociates from beta-arrestin at or near the plasma
membrane and undergoes rapid recycling. Receptor down-
regulation pathways are varying with the agonist and occur
dependent or independent of G-protein coupling. Endogenous
ligands induce rapid desensitization, endocytosis and
recycling whereas morphine induces only low desensitization
and endocytosis. Heterooligomerization with other GPCRs
can modulate agonist binding, signaling and trafficking
properties. Involved in neurogenesis. Isoform 12 couples to
GNAS and is proposed to be involved in excitatory effects.
Isoform 16 and isoform 17 do not bind agonists but may
act through oligomerization with binding-competent OPRM1
isoforms and reduce their ligand binding activity.",NA,NA,NA
